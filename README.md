# srws

srws (Simple rust web server) is a simple HTTP only web server I'm writing in rust in order to learn the language.

I've tried to make the server somewhat safe, however I cannot guarantee it's safety, so if you wish to use it then do so at your own risk. That being said, I've tried using relative paths to read files, both with curl and with netcat and both have just retrieved 404 pages.
